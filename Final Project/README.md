# MA615 Final Project

This project introduces various data visulisation techniques with an example of Yelp dataset.


## Objective
As a business directory service forum, Yelp develops hosts and markets the Yelp.com website and the Yelp mobile app, which publishes crowd-sourced reviews about businesses. With the continuous update, this application has brought more and more features, such as users can evaluate their experiences in different levels of stars and leave comments for various restaurants, which makes it easier and more efficient while looking for the right places to have great food.  As a result, I am interested in analyzing the relationship between reviews and three other factors, which are the star, state, and category, to evaluate the overall quality of restaurants.
